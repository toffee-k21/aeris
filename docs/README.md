# 🌬️ AERIS
### Real-time, low-latency, and designed for scale

AERIS is a **real-time notification service** built on an **event-driven architecture**.  
It enables developers to add **real-time capabilities in minutes**, including  
**channel-based messaging**, **presence monitoring**, and **low-latency event delivery**.

Designed to remain **lightweight while scaling horizontally**, Aeris can handle high  
message throughput efficiently, making it suitable for chat systems, live dashboards,  
multiplayer features, and other real-time applications.
